# CS-255_project
Both the projects for CS-255 

    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    The client DriverPass is a company aiming to reduce the rate of failure at the DMV. They are wanting to solve this by having us develop a cloud based web system that offers driver's education. This system was to allow users to select from three different packages and would gain access to certain features depending on their package selection. The system offered scheduled driving tests, access to online driving tests and lessons, and manage their progress.
    
    What did you do particularly well? 
      In my opinion the specification I had done particularly well on the technical requirement specifications because they align with the customers needs well and I was able to create the diagrams easier because of it.
      
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
      If I could change one thing about it, it would be the nonfunctoinal requirements because it could be improved by adding a braoder security scope and better data protection.
      
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    The customer wanted to reduce the rate of failure on driver tests, cloud based, detailed activity report, and the ability to schedule classes, cars, and instructors.
